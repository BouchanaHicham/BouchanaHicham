## About Me

I am a highly motivated and skilled software developer with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence from Mohamed Khider University of Biskra. I specialize in AI and have a passion for developing mobile apps, video games, and machine learning programs. I'm proud to have two apps published on the Play Store and have authored three reports (PDFs) related to machine learning programs, as well as several others covering various topics in computer science.

## Projects

### Islami App
The Islami App, created using Flutter and Dart, allows users to calculate prayer times based on their GPS location. It features 13 methods of calculation, a Quran with 114 surahs, Qibla detection, Istighfar count, and Azkar for Morning, Evening, and After prayer with their respective rewards.

### Leaf Lo-Fi Music App
I developed the Leaf Lo-Fi Music App using the Flutter framework with Dart programming language, and Visual Studio Code IDE. The app provides users with relaxing music and beats that can help improve work efficiency, study focus, and sleep quality. I also implemented rewarded ads for monetization purposes.

### Hand Guns [Mobile Game] (WIP) 🚧

I developed the Hand Guns mobile game using the Unity game engine with C# programming language and Visual Studio IDE. The game aimed to improve my UI/UX design skills and involved coding physics and math formulas for object movements and projectiles. It also included performance testing programming and animation.

### Artificial Intelligent Projects

- **Chess Program with UI:** Developed using Java and NetBeans, this project includes agents for intelligent gameplay and a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and gameplay.

- **Neural Networks and Boolean Logic:** Implemented neural networks in Python to solve the AND, OR, and XOR problems, along with a research paper discussing the implementation and results.

- **Tabu Search for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem:** Implemented Tabu Search algorithm using Python to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem and wrote a research paper discussing the implementation and results.
